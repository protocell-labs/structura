# Token description

_Structura_ is a long form generative collection exploring tension between the tectonic and the amorphous through a three-dimensional digital composition.

In the 1960s, German-born American architect Konrad Wachsmann created a series of designs for USAF aircraft hangars. His design used flat space truss system composed of tetrahedra and semi-octahedra fabricated out of modular steel elements to create a lightweight and structurally efficient structure with a large span. Space frames have an almost 200 year long history in architecture, yet at the same time they are considered to be futuristic, especially when we consider zero-g and extraterrestrial applications. They are a triumph of mathematics and geometry applied to construction. What makes them so efficient is the fact that they are made mostly out of nothing. To achieve efficiency, structural “height” is added between the two rectangular grids, with space frame members crisscrossing in between. The higher the distance between the grids, the higher the loadbearing capacity, stretching the structure apart until it’s made more out of thin air than rigid material. The basic stable units of a space frame are triangles, which retain stability no matter their configuration. These triangles give space frame cells their stability even when they are deformed. _Structura_ follows in the footsteps of deconstructivist architects such as Peter Eisenman and Lebbeus Woods, who for decades explored structural deformations of this kind through their projects.

In _Structura_, this rational, modular, tectonic (constructed) space frame is contrasted with an amorphous entity residing between physical matter and empty space. Diagrammatic and actual, formed and formless, the amorphous volume pierces the frame to produce unexpected conditions. At times, the volume represents natural rock formations; other times, clouds, vapor, or smoke. Perhaps most accurately, it is a placeholder for flowing space, an idea investigated since at least the Baroque period, reinterpreted in modern times by architects such as Greg Lynn and Zaha Hadid. Here, space itself and its enclosure are superimposed but fully independent, passing through with little regard for each other, z-buffer on the graphics card being the ultimate judge on what is shown first. This superposition creates tension further amplified by the field of spatial disturbance affecting both, seemingly independent but originating from the same algorithmic source, ultimately revealing their purely digital nature.

Controls:

Capture the current view by pressing numbers (1-5), with (5) being the highest quality image. Alternatively, capture a gif animation at 10 fps by pressing (g). You can change the number of frames in the gif by pressing (n), with each key press doubling the frames. Rotate the scene using (a) and modify the rotation angle size with (n). Rotate the light angle with (l), and make it travel in circle with (t). You can get a complete list of controls by pressing (i).
_Structura_ is written in JavaScript and GLSL using THREE.js. This collection was tested on multiple browsers, devices and operating systems. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting. For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration in your browser.
